# hotaru-no-machi
Hotaru no Machi is a short 2D side scrolling game where the player is tasked to collect fireflies and fill them up in street lamps to restore light to a dark town. For every street lamp filled, the player can see more of the town around them.
This was made for a final project using the Phaser framework and Javascript.
